# Fall of Terra – Timeline of UST "de-peg" attack

## Summary

The following postmortum outlines the key events leading up to the "de-pegging" of UST and the subsequent crash of its native currency LUNA. It is meant to provide clarity on the state of the Terra Classic ecosystem as a whole and seperate fact from fiction while the Terra Rebels organization work to repair the damages caused by the stewardship of TFL & LFG, who have clearly decided to give up all hope of salvaging the mess they created and put their efforts into wiping the slate clean via rebooting the ecosystem on Terra v2.


## Timeline

| Time | Event |
| --- | --- |
| 2021-11-25 | A twitter account by the name of Freddie Raynolds outlined a way to attack the existing model of the UST with a capital of $1B. [Reference link](https://twitter.com/FreddieRaynolds/status/1463960623402913797) | 
| 2021-12-?? | Terra aggressively syndicates a deal led by "Jump Crypto, Binance Labs," and others to invest $1B at into the Luna Foundation Guard at a staggered investor unlock of 25% each year. Binance never participated. Previous iterations of the deal included "Tiger Global," who also never participated, as the deal lead. |
| 2021-12-13 | The Anchor Protocol, which had been cashflow-positive for almost all of 2021, becomes cashflow-negative as its deposit popularity outpaces the popularity of its borrowing. It would never regain cashflow positivity. [Reference link](https://grafana.luigi311.com/d/7j96rRI7z/anchor?orgId=2&from=now-1y&to=now) |
| 2021-12-27 | Crypto blogger "Recovering TradFi Chad" posts a lengthy speculative critique of the Degenbox, Anchor's deteriorating solvency, and the institutional investor private placement, arguing that Anchor is being run in the ground to artificially inflate LUNA's price and lock liquidity into the Astroport DEX which was about to launch at the time.

| 2022-02-17 | Do Kwon injects $450M into the Anchor Protocol to keep Anchor's 20% yield operational. [Reference Link](https://forecrypto.net/terra-injects-450m-ust-into-anchor-reserve-days-before-protocol-depletion-2/) |
| 2022-03-?? | Anchor's Reserve rapidly deteriorates as deposit inflows accelerate. On the Anchor governance forums, ParaFi, Arca, Polychain and others propose various methods of reducing Anchor's yield. [Reference Link](https://dirtroads.substack.com/p/-34-anchor-protocol-too-big-to-thrive) Terra devs heap unanimous scorn on the Arca and Parafi proposals on Twitter. Ultimately Anchor settles on a 6 month roadmap to reduce the yield to ~12%, vs cashflow breakeven of ~6%.|
| 2022-04-13 | Luna Foundation Guard acquires more BTC. [Reference link](https://news.coincu.com/80549-luna-foundation-buys-2500-bitcoin-during-40k/) | 
| 2022-05-01 | The Terra idle capital ratio, defined as (Anchor deposits - Anchor loans) / (Terra TVL), which stayed at 10% or less through January 2022, has ballooned to 35% of Terra TVL: 35% of total Terra TVL ($12B) is now overnight liquidity doing nothing but farming the Anchor yield, able to vanish at the first sign of trouble. |
| 2022-05-06 | Luna Foundation Guard acquires more BTC in OTC trading with Genesis Trading & 3AC. [Reference link](https://news.coincu.com/86477-luna-has-acquired-37863-bitcoins/) | 
| 2022-05-07 | Large amounts of UST withdrawn from Anchor Protocol. | 
| 2022-05-08 | UST was sold off on UST-3pool with about 285 million UST sold on Binance and Curve. 3pool almost recovered at the end of the day, which causes another discharge of UST into the markets. This time that resulted in the UST rate skyrocketing to around 65%. | 
| 2022-05-09 | Luna Foundation Guard used BTC in reserves to help defend the UST peg by loaning $750M worth of BTC to OTC trading firms, additionally another 750M $UST loan was granted to accumulate BTC as market conditions normalize. | 
| 2022-05-10 | LUNA 10 billion capitalizations have been wiped out. $9 billion of TVL was also withdrawn from the Terra ecosystem. UST has de-pegged from USDT and UST briefly droppes to $0.74. | 
| 2022-05-11 | LUNA Death Spiral begins. After throwing all the reserves into the market to pull the price of UST back to peg, Terra governance accepts sacrificing the price of LUNA to save its derivative UST product by changing the mechanism to burn UST and mint more LUNA. Specifically increasing BasePool size from 50M to 100M SDR and decreasing PoolRecoveryBlock from 36 to 18 Blocks. The idea was to increases mint/burn UST/LUNA capacity from $293M to $1200M in order to absorb UST being sold in the market. As a consequence the total amount of minted LUNA went to 1,190,951,936 and price began its decend from $30 towards $0.01. | 
| 2022-05-12 | After proposing 1164 to change the mint/burn LUNA/UST parameters, Terra governance launched proposal 1188, the idea was that by burning the remaining UST in the Community Pool and withdrawing all USTs in other ecosystems would reduce pressure on the peg. At the same time Terra would stake 240M LUNA to protect the network from an oracle attack. If this proposal was passed UST would be removed from the supply and thus relieve some of the selling pressure on UST. However, before the proposal was approved, the UST completely collapsed. | 
| 2022-05-12 | The validators on the Terra network decided to pause the blockchain at block number 7,603,700 to prevent governance attacks after the LUNA token was severely inflated.

| 2022-05-13 | Binance delisted LUNA & UST trading pairs. [Reference link](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/1b73e64616ee4e769c29e70c66728d1a?ref=AZTKZ9XS&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocial) |
| 2022-05-13 | All efforts to save LUNA and UST were almost dissipated. Do Kwon proposed a new idea to “re-invent” the Terra network called the "Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan". |
| 2022-05-14 | The official circulating supply of LUNA hits 6.5 trillion tokens. Most likely caused by Luna Foundation Guard efforts to defend the UST peg with a "broken swap algo" |
| 2022-05-16 | Luna Foundation Guard reveales the status of their reserve fund on Twitter, as well as the fact that they had burnt billions of dollars trying to save UST from collapse. [Reference link](https://twitter.com/LFG_org/status/1526126708193054721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1526126708193054721%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.coincu.com%2F90055-fall-of-terra%2F) |
| 2022-05-17 | Despite advice from CZ that a forked chain is worthless and against the will of the ecosystem at large Terra governance decides to create a new chain. The new chain will be Terra v2 without the algorithmic stablecoin. At this point TFL & LFG largely abandons their failed v1 experiment. |
| 2022-05-18 | Terra Rebels is founded in an effort to preserve the Terra Classic code after TFL & LFG have seemingly abandoned their responsibilities. |
| 2022-06-05 | Terra Rebels submit 3 different PRs to Terra Money in order to re-enable functionality that was disabled without a proper governance vote. [#775](https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core/pull/775), [#776](https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core/pull/776) & [#778](https://github.com/terra-money/classic-core/pull/778) |
| 2022-06-12 | Terra Rebels begin working on "burn tax" proposals. |
| 2022-06-19 | Terra Rebels have yet to hear anything from TFL & LFG. |
| 2022-06-22 | Terra Proposal 4095, "Re-enable Staking/Delegation to Existing Active Validator Set Only," passes with 90.67% of 165,318,228 staked LUNC. 43 validators voted yes, 5 abstained, and none were rejected or vetoed. |
| 2022-06-22 | Validators who Abstained included ChainLayer, danku_zone w/ DAIC, Mr. K, Easy 2 Stake, and TTLG Money. |
| 2022-06-22 | Validators who didn't vote included Orion.Money (14.13%), hashed (4.13%), DSRV (3.06%), Figment (2.76%), Certus One (2.45%), Terran One (2.45%), Terra Bites (1.95%), Aardvark (1.74%), StakeWith.Us (1.67%), Staked (1.55%), blockscape, BinanceStaking, MANTRA DAO, ISS, TerraIsMoreThanUST, 319B5FDFEF84, 0base.vc, Mosaic, RockX, Arrington XRP Capital, coinbevy, TerraDactyl, Craig, Inotel, SeltonStake.com - sunsetting soon, KiKi Finance, Pixy, OneStar, TaiPanich, MissionControl, Galactic Punks Validator, Stake5 Labs, DACM (.09%), and appx 15 others with negligible votes. |

## Contributing Factors

- 20% interest on UST in Anchor with a fractional reserve banking system was never going to work. Most likely early investors knew this.
- Failure to provide sufficient collateralization to the UST market enabled the publically disclosed exploit to be used to crash UST & LUNA markets.
- Inexperienced management in TFL & LFG lead to bad decission making during the de-pegging event which cost billions of USD and minted trillions of LUNA.
- Hypercentralized management of the LFG meant that Kwon, in consultation with Jump Crypto, made all decisions. Other LFG Multisig signatories (Remi Tetot, Delphi, Nicholas Platias) were unable or unwilling to exercise meaningful independent judgment. 
- Nexus and Prism were the only two major protocols whose employees weren't direct employees of TFL. The entire rest of the "ecosystem" was beholden to Kwon in various off-chain ways, usually depending on him for a paycheck and/or protocol funding.
- Proposing the "Terra Ecosystem Revival Plan" caused the existing ecosystem to fracture with all the "bag holders" left behind on Terra Classic and all the "smart money" moving to Terra v2.
- TFL & LFG refusal to engage with the Terra Rebels developer community caused people to leave the Terra ecosystem permanently and is preventing the Terra Classic governance system from working as intended.


## Lessons Learned

- Don't do fractional reserve banking with a 100% debt-2-asset ratio and unlimited supply cap.
- During a crisis, transparency is critical to helping the community make informed judgment. Reserve management to defend the currency peg must be open and transparent at all costs.
- "If you don't know where the yield is coming from, it's probably you."
- Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. "We'll get to centralization later" invariably turns into "Decentralization is great to talk about, but between you and me, decentralization isn't happening anytime soon." The opportunities created by protocol centralization (information asymmetry, self-dealing, etc) are irresistible for virtually everyone.
- If a mechanism appears purely worthless or parasitic to the ecosystem (like the Degenbox), it very likely is.

## Action Items

- Re-enable Staking & Delegation in Terra Classic to allow proper governance to form over time. 
- Re-enable Swapping of LUNA => Terra & Terra => LUNA with new "supply constraints" to speed up the burn of LUNA tokens.
- Implement the burn proposals from the community
- Setup a independant CI/CD pipeline for terrad clients to enable validators to swap to software managed by Terra Rebels.
- Enable community validators to be setup and manged in order to strengthen the network as a whole
